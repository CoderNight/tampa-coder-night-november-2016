# Tampa Coder Night - November 2016

This month, we're going to work on a fun problem proposed by Robert Bieber.

"Two words are friends if they have a Levenshtein distance of 1 (For details see Levenshtein distance). That is, you can add, remove, or substitute exactly one letter in word X to create word Y. A word’s social network consists of all of its friends, plus all of their friends, and all of their friends’ friends, and so on. Write a program to tell us how big the social network for the given word is, using our word list."
